## Pairwise t-tests for post-hoc analysis of a one-way ANOVA, including Bonferroni and Holm-Bonferroni Correction, and Tukey's HSD
## This file is intended for use after the one-way ANOVA file and may not work if the variables are not defined as in the previous file
## cat_var must be defined as a factor (see previous file)
## Note that these corrections are meant to apply to equal n in each group and equal variances (use bartlett.test if necessary)

#pairwise t-test, no correction 

pairwise.t.test(cont_var,cat_var,p.adj="none")

#pairwise t-test, bonferroni correction

pairwise.t.test(cont_var,cat_var,p.adj="bonf")

#pairwise t-test, holm correction

pairwise.t.test(cont_var,cat_var,p.adj="holm")

#Tukey's Honestly Significant Differences Test using previously created aov model
